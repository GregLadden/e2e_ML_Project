## Starting Jupyter Notebooks

To start working with Jupyter Notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   Make sure your virtual environment is activated. Depending on your operating system, use the appropriate command:

   - **macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**

   With your virtual environment activated, start the Jupyter Notebook server by running:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
